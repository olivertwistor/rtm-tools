## Background
[Remember the Milk][1] is a service for creating to-do lists. It provides 
advanced ways to filter and sort items on those to-do lists. I have used the 
service for many years, and I can highly recommend it. Despite all the praise I 
have for the service, it lacks some features. That is where this project comes 
in.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide extended features to the Remember 
the Milk service, for example metadata about lists such as the number of tasks 
per priority.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to extend the Remember the Milk service in the 
following ways:
* calculate the number of tasks per priority in each list
* calculate the total estimated time per priority of each list
* get a sublist from a list that is limited by a certain amount of time, for 
example 8 hours for a workday

## Stakeholders
The primary stakeholders in this project is people who already make extensive 
use of Remember the Milk.
