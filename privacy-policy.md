# Privacy policy
When using Todo List Tools you are connecting to a [Remember the Milk][1] 
account. Thereby you are exposing data within that account.

## What data is collected
In order for this app to authenticate itself to the [Remember the Milk 
API][2], the user is required to enter username and password. That is only 
necessary once, because after a successful login, the app retrieves a unique 
token that is used for authentication from that point forward.

Once authenticated to Remember the Milk, this app retrieves information about  
every list and smartlist found in the account, the lists themselves the user 
selects and the tasks within those lists.

## How data is used
The collected data mentioned earlier in this document is used to present 
aggregations and calculations on that data to the user.

## What data is stored
The only piece of data stored is the authentication token. That token is 
stored in a configuration file on the user's device. When the app has exited, 
all other data such as lists and tasks are gone, since it only resides in 
memory.
