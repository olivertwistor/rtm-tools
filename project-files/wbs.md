# Work breakdown structure

* The app must be renamed. RTM, Remember or Milk must not be part of the name.
* Add "This product uses the Remember The Milk API but is not endorsed or 
certified by Remember The Milk." to both the readme file and in the start of 
the app.
* Openly disclose how the app is collecting, using and storing personal data, 
both in notice within the app and in a separate privacy policy document (maybe 
be copied to the root build folder).
